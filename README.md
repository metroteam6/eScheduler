management. Factors such as fluctuations in customer demand and service time affect the
appointment scheduling systems’ performance in terms of, for example, patients’ waiting time,
idle time of resources, and total cost/profits.

Also, they can update or cancel their appointments.  Doctors can view the upcoming appointments and patient records either is active or cancelled.
